[Paper] Feature Selection For SVM using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (Updating)

Keywords: Data Science, Outlier Detection, Feature Selection, Support Vector Machine, Mixed-Integer Linear Programming.

This paper proposes a robust classification model based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) that simultaneously addresses both outlier detection and feature selection. The problem is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) 
model. The selection of relevant features for defining the separating hyperplanes is 
incorporated into the model through a budget constraint, which limits the number of 
features, while the pinball loss function is used to detect outliers in the classification 
process. We propose both exact and heuristic methods to solve this formulation
efficiently. Finally, the model is validated using several well-known datasets and 
compared with other models.
