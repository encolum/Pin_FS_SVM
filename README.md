[Paper] Optimal Robust Feature Selection For Support
Vector Machines With Pinball Loss

Keywords: Data Science, Outlier Detection, Feature Selection, Support Vector Machine, Mixed-Integer Linear Programming.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been widely
used for classification tasks, but face significant challenges in-
cluding sensitivity to noise and outliers, and the critical need
for effective feature selection. This paper proposes a robust
Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model based on
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that simultaneously addresses
both issues. Our model, Pin-FS-SVM, incorporates a budget
constraint to limit feature selection and employs the pinball
loss function for noise and outlier handling in the classification
process. Experiments on multiple datasets show that Pin-FS-SVM
outperforms existing methods in robustness to noise and outliers,
achieves better feature reduction, and maintains competitive
performance.
